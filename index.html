            <p>My favorite hobby is crafting because I love to create and invent things. I love using different materials to create things, like a card for a friend, necklaces, bracelets, earrings, snakes and ladders and more. So basically crafting is something that you can express what you are feeling, emotions and what you are thinking of and this is why crafting is my favorite hobby.</p>
